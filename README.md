#h3 Pattern check

This program checks to see if a specific pattern is within a line
Here is a generic pattern example xyyx that is considered valid

If a line contains a similar pattern it is considered valid.
However if the pattern is within brackets that line that it was found in is considered invalid.



absfefwabba[afdsfe]fbowroeojirq		-> this is valid because of abba
sfodsjfoi[vpfvffvpwefok]wefdoeeodsfl 	-> this is invalid because of vffv is inside the brackets


The program is scalable so it can check for a bigger or smaller patternQ
